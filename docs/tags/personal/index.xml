      <description>There are only four states of being, or identity. Awareness, I (self), Dream (other), Universe (all).
Awareness This is the state you are born into, the state of being when you are first conscious of external stimuli. As an entity with awareness, the only requirement is one can acknowledge receiving some form of flow, or energy.
Examples: A baby crying. An insect navigating around.
I (Self-Awareness) This is the state in which you begin to recognize one self.</description>

      <description>Although as individuals we are always in transition, I believe it is necesary to have static markers representing our current state in reference to the universe. We are mortal, we were born into this world, and inevitably we will eventually die. Consider this post to mark the beginning of a quarter life transition. I figure that the best way to measure and document this is to have an open, publicly available record of my goals and my journey in pursuing meaning in life.</description>
