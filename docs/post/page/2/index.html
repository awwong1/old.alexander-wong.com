    <img class="post-cover" src="https://alexander-wong.com/img/avatar.png" alt="Four States of Being">
  
  <p class="post-summary">There are only four states of being, or identity. Awareness, I (self), Dream (other), Universe (all).
Awareness This is the state you are born into, the state of being when you are first conscious of external stimuli. As an entity with awareness, the only requirement is one can acknowledge receiving some form of flow, or energy.
Examples: A baby crying. An insect navigating around.
I (Self-Awareness) This is the state in which you begin to recognize one self.</p>
