      <description>My name is Alexander Wong. I am a software developer. Typically, I spend most of my time writing software and discussing philosophy. When I&amp;rsquo;m not working on Udia, I spend my time running or hiking. In the winter, I ski. I enjoy playing my guitar and listening to folk music.</description>

      <description>Although as individuals we are always in transition, I believe it is necesary to have static markers representing our current state in reference to the universe. We are mortal, we were born into this world, and inevitably we will eventually die. Consider this post to mark the beginning of a quarter life transition. I figure that the best way to measure and document this is to have an open, publicly available record of my goals and my journey in pursuing meaning in life.</description>
